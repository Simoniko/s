<p><strong>So many gorgeous little accessories to add to your Sylvanian fun!</strong></p>
<p><span>Prepare your Sylvanians for their excursion with the Day Trip Accessory Set! Includes a backpack to keep their bits ‘n’ bobs safe, a straw hat to keep the sun off their ears and of course, a camera to take snaps of the scenery! From a matching strawberry earband and purse, to pretty bunny ear-shaped headbands, this set has all the essentials for Sylvanian girlies out on a day trip at Adventure Island! There's even a teenie tiny whale clutch, and a watch to make sure they make it back home on time; what more could they need for their summertime adventures?</span></p>
<p><strong>The highlight of this set for me is the little black camera with a neck strap! I'd buy this set just for this miniature camera alone!</strong></p>

<p>FATHER STANLEY FLETCHER is a Forest Ranger. He knows everything there is to know about living in the great outdoors and loves to share his knowledge with the boys and girls of Sylvania. Whatever Stanley has planned, you can be sure he always rounds everyone up at the end of each day and leads them safely back home!</p>
<p>MOTHER PETUNIA FLETCHER loves to fuss, she always checks to see that her husband has a spare compass in his pocket, as well as extra batteries for his torch. Even if the sun is shining she puts a thick sweater in his rucksack well you never know when it might get a little chilly!</p>
<p>BROTHER SCOTT FLETCHER is just like his father. He loves being surrounded by nature and wants to be a Forest Ranger too when he grows up. But all he can think about at the moment is cross country running! Whatever the weather he can be found deep in the Sylvanian countryside running!</p>
<p>SISTER JODIE FLETCHER is quite different to everyone else in her family. She is very quiet and loves being at home playing with her toy figurines. Her favourite game is to hide them all over the garden, she then likes to round them up!</p>
<p>BABY TWINS MIA AND JEREMY FLETCHER never keep still. They are always racing each other around the garden and if they are not jumping over the daffodils they are jumping over each other! They only quieten down when their exasperated mother tells them to!</p>
<p>This is a Limited Edition 35th Anniversary Family Set. - Brand new in box.</p>
<p>This is the last of our brand new stock.</p>
<p>Ages: 3+</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Baerenwald Forest Families Parrot Family of 4 - RARE VINTAGE</p>
<p>This gorgeous Parrot family is not Sylvanian, but is in fact a vintage Forest Families Brand set from the 1980's.  There were several different brands on the market in the 1980's/early 1990's selling similar flocked figures to the Sylvanian range. </p>
<p><strong>Points to Note</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Glue marking</strong> -  Mr Parrot has some flocking defects on his head (where his hat originally had been glued on) See images below. Mr Parrot also has a tiny knick on his flocking on the base of his tail. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1780/1487/files/323544389_554847029850407_7898985947941068331_n_480x480.jpg?v=1672732125" alt=""></p>
<p>- <strong>Clothing</strong> - Originally Mrs Parrot wore a blue dress, but this unfortunately isn't with the set. Also Mr Parrot wore a black hat, which in the original set would have been glued to his head (this is how they were sold) however, unfortunately his hat has been removed by a previous owner, leaving a glue mark and defect on his flocking.</p>
<p>- Mrs Parrot has a small red mark beside her nose. See close up pictures. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #404040;">Sizing: The below picture shows Freya Rabbit alongside the Parrot Family. Freya the Sylvanian Rabbit is not included, but is only in images to show the height of the figures in comparison to a Sylvanian figure.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #404040;"><img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1780/1487/files/323092540_885585362639598_387189320407961787_n_480x480.jpg?v=1672732058"></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Overall, in spite of the points mentioned above, these are in beautiful, bright and gorgeous condition. They are a rarity and a prize for any collection.</p>
<p>Condition: Very Good pre-owned vintage condition. <br></p>
<p><span>This sale is for 4 x pre-owned Forest Families vintage figures.</span></p>
<p><span>No box</span></p>
<p><span>Forest Families Brand 1980's</span></p>
<p>Recommended for Age 3+<br></p>
<p>General note for most pre-owned figures:</p>
<p>Figures that are listed as pre-owned have likely been displayed or played with and cannot be expected to be perfect.  They will never be as immaculate as a brand new item and may show some signs of wear or use, fading or discolouration. We do our best to list any features or imperfections that are of note. If you are a collector who is concerned about purchasing only immaculate figures, pre-owned figures are likely not the right fit for you. In this case, we would suggest only buying brand new sets.</p>
<p>Other figures or accessories in the photo are not included and are for photo-styling purposes only.</p>

<p>Mapletown was a US Brand of Toys in the 1980's, similar to Sylvanian Families of its era. They weren't so well known in UK or Australia, but from time to time one may turn up.</p>
<p>Here is Mr Racoon. I've placed him in images beside Freya Rabbit to give an idea of height compared to a Sylvanian Figure. He is taller than the average Sylvanian figure.</p>
<p>What a beauty of a tail he has too!  He might add a bit of "attitude" to your Sylvanian town!</p>
<p>The figure is in very good pre-owned condition. </p>
<p>This sale is for 1 x figure.</p>
<p>Note that some vintage figures moveable joints may be a little stiff in moving them, due to age.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>Sylvanian Families Dandelion Twin Rabbits of also known as Ivory Rabbits or also Butterglove rabbits - Preowned - RARE1992</p>
<p>The family name of these twins is all a little bit confusing. Their family members, over time, have been known by various names: Ivory Rabbits, Butterglove Rabbits and these twins, when they were released, were called Dandelion Rabbit Twins. </p>
<p>Ivory Rabbits were released exclusively in Japan in the late 1990's. Later the Butterglove Rabbits were released, not as a family, but in individual sets with accessories in the UK around 2001 and onward.</p>
<p>The Dandelion rabbit twins are known by one distinctively floppy ear, one ear bent more than the other. They're more of a fawn brown colour than the milk rabbits and yet not as dark as a Dappledawn rabbit. </p>
<p>Excellent condition. Only a tiny little bit of wear on the tip of one's ears.  Brother twin's romper pants are a little twisted.<br></p>
<p>Very collectible. Hard to find</p>
<p><span>No box</span></p>
<p><span>As we mention with all of our pre-owned items, they will never be as immaculate as a brand new item. There may be slight signs of playwear or use in any pre-owned figure. Also limbs may be slightly stiff to move, due to age. </span></p>
<p>Recommended for Age 3+<br></p>
<p>Other accessories seen in images are not included, but are for styling purposes only.</p>

<p>Baby Marmalade bear is wearing a pink romper suit and comes with a crib and bottle. </p>
<p>This is rather a unique Australian-only version of the Marmalade Bear Baby. This family are also known as the Porridge Ginger Bears in UK. They were called the Marmalade Bear Family only in their Australian release. They are very different from the UK version of the Marmalade Bears.</p>
<p>Note that although this item is brand new, the box is a little worn with dog-eared corners, some creases and the clear plastic front of box is a little crumpled, as seen in images.  Figure inside is immaculate. </p>
<ul></ul>
<p>Brand new in box.  Box is a little worn.</p>
